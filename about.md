This is the blog of Ricardo Ochoa Sosa. I'm a Doctoral student at [National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)](www.unam.mx/index/en) and Project Leader in Urban Studies at [Mario Molina Center](http://centromariomolina.org/english/). My recent work has been largely focused on economic and social assessments of cities, neighborhoods and buildings.

### Research activities

#### Metropolitan profile 2015--2016
For [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org) and [CONACYT](www.conacyt.mx)

A set of economic and environmental indicators is been developed for assessing and comparing the performance of 59 cities in Mexico. Metrics are being developed for three urban expansion scenarios and include infrastructure costs, CO$_2$eq emissions, primary energy and several financial indicators.

#### RapidFire model for MÃ©xico City 2013--2015
For [CONACYT](www.conacyt.mx)

The RapidFire model is a user-friendly, spreadsheet-based tool that is used to produce and evaluate city-level scenarios. The model was adapted to Mexico City by the Mario Molina Center in partnership with 
[ITDP](www.itdp.org)
[EMBARQ](www.embarq.org)
[Calthorpe Associates](www.calthorpe.com) and
[Fehr & Peers](www.fehrandpeers.com).

#### Environmental impacts of commuting as a function of house location 2013--2015
For [CONACYT](www.conacyt.mx) and [IADB](http://www.iadb.org)

A web-based tool was developed to compare locations for neighborhoods development. The tool requires information about house type and location, and performs a set of GIS-based calculations to estimate the  transport-related GHG.
